Overview:

This repository demonstrates the usage of essential Python libraries: Pandas, TextBlob, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Streamlit. These libraries are vital for data manipulation, visualization, natural language processing, and building interactive web applications.

Libraries:
	1. Pandas
	Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It offers data structures like 		 DataFrame and Series to handle structured data effectively.
	
Key Features:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Handling missing data
Grouping and aggregations
Data wrangling with ease

2. TextBlob
TextBlob is a simple NLP library built on top of NLTK and Pattern. It provides tools for text processing and analysis, including sentiment analysis, tokenization, and translation.

Key Features:
Sentiment analysis (polarity and subjectivity)
Tokenization and word inflection
Spelling correction

3. Seaborn
Seaborn is a data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.

Key Features:
Heatmaps, pair plots, and violin plots
Integration with Pandas DataFrames
Built-in themes for plots
